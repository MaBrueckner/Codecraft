    "title": "About Me",
    "profile": "Profile",
    "description": "Full Stack Developer",
    "text1": "I have been working as a professional software developer for over a decade – but my passion for technology began much earlier: At the age of 15, I programmed my first applications on the C64, later with Turbo Pascal on a 386. Today, I develop modern software solutions for complex automation processes – with a broad technological spectrum ranging from C#, WPF, and Blazor to LabVIEW and PLC programming in the TIA Portal.",
    "text2": "My focus is on special-purpose machine construction, particularly in process automation. I handle both the development of individual components and the complete implementation of entire cells – from PLC and HMI to data integration with ERP systems. My versatility sets me apart: while others specialize, I connect worlds – whether it's microcontrollers in C, OPC UA, SQL databases, or modern UI/UX concepts. I find a solution for every problem – technology-agnostic, structured, and solution-oriented.",
    "text3": "I am currently looking for exciting remote projects that I can implement flexibly alongside my permanent position – whether as support or as independent development. I work reliably, with quick onboarding and a clear focus on customer value. If you're looking for a developer who not only writes code but also understands and thinks through processes, I look forward to hearing from you."
